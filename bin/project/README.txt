The Secret Number Game By William Nguma

Game Objective:
•	Guess the secret number between 0 - 100, randomly generated by the computer
•	User gets 5 tries to enter the correct number
•	Computer will display an appropriate message, depending on whether the secret number is greater or less then the number you've entered.
•	A difference of 5 numbers or less, will display an additional message: "You are so close!!!"
•	Hint: Although it feels difficult to guess a number between 0-100 in 5 tries, if we always give the midpoint of our range, 80% of times we will guess the correct number

Running the program:
•	Kindly note that because a random number is generated every time, it’s not possible to tell which exact values to enter.
•	We are printing the secret number in the beginning of the program. This will help you check the game.
•	Kindly start with number 50, for the best possible results.
•	Entering the mid-point of the range of values will help.
